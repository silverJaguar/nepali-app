    "description": "Nepal is a deeply spiritual country where religion is woven into everyday life. The majority of Nepalis are Hindu, followed by Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, and indigenous Kiratis. Temples, shrines, and prayer flags are common sights. Many households perform daily puja (prayer rituals), and religious festivals often blend elements from multiple traditions. Respect for religious diversity is a core part of Nepali identity.",

Popular snacks include momo (dumplings), sel roti (a sweet rice donut), and chatpate (spicy puffed rice). Meals are often eaten with the hands, and sharing is a sign of closeness. Regional cuisines—like Newari feasts or Thakali thalis—reflect Nepal’s rich cultural diversity.",

(used for emphasis or disbelief), or dai/bhai/didi (used like 'bro' or 'sis' even with strangers). Urban youth often mix English and Nepali in a casual blend called Nenglish.

Mornings often begin early, with tea, household chores, and religious rituals like lighting incense or offering food to deities. In rural areas, people farm or tend animals, while urban life revolves around school, business, or office work. Streets buzz with motorbikes, street vendors, and informal chatter. Load-shedding, water collection, and community interactions shape the rhythm of daily routines. Though pace and access vary by region, a strong sense of family and resilience connects everyday life across Nepal.",
